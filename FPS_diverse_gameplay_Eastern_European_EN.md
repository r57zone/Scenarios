## Gameplay:
The main mechanics of the game are shooting, but one shooting quickly gets boring. Shooting is the basis, but not the entire gameplay. The gameplay should be varied, only a variety of thoughtful gameplay will really appeal to players. This is an example of such games as: Uncharted, Metro 2033, Last of Us, Tomb Raider, and so on. 
<br>Gameplay mechanics in addition to shooting:
1. Driving a car. The main character can manage various types of transport found in missions, such as cargo (ZIL), passenger (those that can be used without a license) and military (tanks, APCS), as well as snowmobiles, motorcycles. Different types of transport are used in different events.
2. Shooting from military equipment (tanks, as the chief Manager) and armored personnel carriers as a shooting back.
3. Shooting machine guns, how on Crysis 2, deterring enemy cars in the game.
4. Quick time events. For example, on the road on which the snowmobile will go, the rope will be stretched and if you do not press the key combination during, the main character is knocked off the snowmobile by the rope and falls, "Game over".



## Technical features of the gameplay:
Support for Sony DualShock 4, Nintendo Switch Pro controller, and Steam controller gamepads. If a player has one of these gamepads or is playing on a Sony PlayStation4 platform (or possibly a Nintendo Switch), then they will be actively using the gamepad's gyroscope. If desired, the player can enable the traditional control type, as well as it will be for all outdated input types. The gyroscope will be used for more accurate aiming in games (on the stick approximate aiming, and the gyroscope accurate aiming), as well as the gyroscope will be used to move the steering wheel in cars (not in all types of cars), for the movement of the tank tower, and so on.


## Environment:
The locations are located in an Eastern European country, typical old high-rise buildings, typical typical courtyards and typical private homes. The Chapter of actions takes place in an urban area, the some actions in a "forest" area.
The map is limited, meaning the world is pseudo-open, small, similar to Metro Exodus. Small maps where events take place, at the end of the maps are tricky passage restrictions, broken buildings, broken trees, a river, a moat, and so on.
